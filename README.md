Thank you for reading now here's a cookie to keep you safe üç™.

## Requirements
- Node.js 15 or higher
- A brain (hopefully one that can think)
- A simple ability to read directions

## Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/spinfal/nft-heist.git
```
```
cd nft-heist
```
```
npm i
```
```
node . <username>
```

## Note: By default it will download 50 nfts to change that add argument at end
```
node . <username> no_of_downloads 
```
## Why aren't some users working?
To be honest; I don't know. I don't know much about OpenSea or NFTs, all I know is if the url looks like this: `https://opensea.io/collection/<username>` then it will work. Otherwise, it will not. But you can still try it.
